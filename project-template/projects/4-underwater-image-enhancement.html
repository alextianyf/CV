            <h3>Underwater Image Enhancement (L²UWE Reimplementation)</h3>
            <!-- Project description -->
            <p>
            This project reimplements the L²UWE pipeline—an efficient framework for enhancing low-light underwater images using local contrast and multi-scale fusion—originally proposed by Tunai Porto Marques and Professor Alexandra Branzan Albu at the University of Victoria. 
            Under Professor Albu’s supervision, I reproduced this work in 2023 using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, faithfully following the methodology described in the original paper. 
            The pipeline includes local contrast estimation, dark channel refinement, radiance recovery, and multi-scale Laplacian pyramid fusion, all designed from scratch with a strong emphasis on code clarity and educational visualization. 
            Unlike black-box deep learning models, L²UWE is grounded in physical intuition and image formation theory, making it interpretable and efficient. The implementation is applicable to marine ecology, underwater robotics, archaeological preservation, 
            and submerged infrastructure inspection, and it significantly deepened my understanding of image enhancement theory and underwater visual processing.
