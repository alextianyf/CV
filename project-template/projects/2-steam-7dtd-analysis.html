            <!-- Project description -->
            <p>
                A personal research project applying data science and machine learning to Steam player data.
                Starting with <em>7 Days to Die</em>, Regression models are built to analyze and predict achievement efficiency
                (Polynomial R²≈0.96, Random Forest R²≈0.90), identified distinct player segmentation through
                clustering (generalists, crafters, explorers, fighters, early quitters), and A/B testing demonstrated that
                multiplayer engagement significantly boosts playtime. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This research showcases how data-driven methods can reveal retention risks, inform content
                design, and even support anomaly or cheater detection. Future work will expand to other Steam
                titles and explore sequential modeling of achievement unlocks with RNNs.
