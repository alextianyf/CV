# Alex Tian â€” CV & Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal CV and portfolio repository.

This project contains the source code for my academic and professional website, where I showcase my background in electrical engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. The site features a responsive design, interactive project filters, and clean presentation for my key experiences, research contributions, and technical skill sets.

## How It Works

- All project cards are written modularly in `project-template/projects/`.
- The `build_projects.py` script assembles them into a complete `projects.html` using template start/end files.
- This enables easier content management and cleaner version control over your portfolio items.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 (no frameworks)
- Python (for project aggregation)
- JavaScript (for filtering and interactivity)
- Netlify / GitHub Pages (for deployment)
